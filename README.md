# Project Request
A mobile app will provide information about what Energy Assistance financial support is available, how to qualify for it, and who is eligible for funding. It will link to online application forms, so that potential clients can sign up easily and provide the information necessary for our staff to review their application for funding support. Calculate basic eligibility through series of questions (city of seattle, income level), then fill out the application form (about 16-24 questions), and submit documents by taking photos of those documents.
